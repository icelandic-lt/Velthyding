# Velthyding.is -- Icelandic Machine Translation Website

## Introduction

*Velthyding.is* is a web front end, written in Javascript using React, for Miðeind's neural machine translation engine.
The web allows translation of text and documents between Icelandic and English.
Both the web and the engine are under rapid development.

Try Velthyding at [https://velthyding.is](https://velthyding.is)!

## Requirements and installation

You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. Run `yarn run` for a local development server and `yarn build` to package the interface for public use.

## Configuration

See `config.js` for setting endpoint domains, default selections and customizing branding (logo, colors). Endpoints need to follow the [Google translate REST specification](https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest) for compatibility with the interface.
