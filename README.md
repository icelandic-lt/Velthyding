# Greynir-MT-Web -- Machine Translation Interace

## Introduction

This is a thin web client written in Javascript using React for comparing translations between different endpoints.

## Requirements and installation

You’ll need to have Node >= 8.10 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine, run `yarn run` for a local development server and `yarn build` to package the interface for public use.

## Configuration

See `config.js` for setting endpoint domains and default selections. Endpoints need to follow the [Google translate REST specification][https://cloud.google.com/translate/docs/reference/rest] for compatibility with the interface.
